  Code review context: Common (Scala/JS/Python).
  Review scope: diffs from this commit.
requirement: |
  Tasks:
  - Check if there are any security vulnerabilities in the code (e.g., injection risks, unsafe deserialization, insecure config/secrets, insufficient authz/authn, logging leakage). If no issues found, output [].

  Output format requirements (strictly follow):
  - Output only two tags: <output> and <thought>
  - <output> contains a valid JSON array with the following structure:
    [
      {
        "title": "Summary in Chinese and English, less than 30 words, no quotes and backslashes",
        "content": "Description in Chinese and English, no quotes and backslashes; must explain why it's incorrect, provide evidence; include incorrect code and improved code snippets in markdown code blocks",
        "filepath": "File path @ line number range, no quotes and backslashes"
      }
    ]
  - JSON must properly escape quotes, backslashes, etc. inside JSON value fields; outside <output> tag, no need to escape newlines
  - <thought> describes your reasoning process and which guidelines were violated
order: "business,requirement"
